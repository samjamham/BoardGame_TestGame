# BoardGame_TestGame
Trying to make a board game in Unity.

I am attempting to a game in unity which recrates what it would feel like to be a game piece. Imagine you have been shrunk down to the size of a D&D miniature and you have an entire world to explore. all from your groups tabletop.
I do not claim to be an artist and many of the assets (art wise) I have taken from the Unity store page.
